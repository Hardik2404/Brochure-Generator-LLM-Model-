      "Volkschem Crop Science Pvt. Ltd based in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India is Manufacturer, Supplier & Exporter of Best Quality Bio Pesticide. Bio Pesticides have their use in agriculture for many years and trusted by all because of their ability to improve the fertility of the soil. Biopesticides are naturally occurring material that biologically control harmful pests, particularly among field crops. These are naturally produced bio chemical materials basically non-toxic to the environment that can be employed in pest control. Our range of Biopesticides offer an environmentally effective solution compared to the harmful effects of synthetic pesticides. Unlike biopesticides, chemical pesticides are not target specific apart from killing the harmful pests they also end up destroying plant friendly organisms such as earth warm, nitrogen fixing bacteria and algae that help plants to suck nutrients from soil, water and air. Although they help the farmers with increased output, they also result in polluting the environment. However, biopesticides are harmless, target specific and biodegradable.\n",
